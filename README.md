# Credit Card Fraud Detection

🚀 A machine learning project to detect fraudulent transactions using the popular credit card fraud dataset.

## 📌 Overview

- Classification problem using imbalanced dataset
- Implemented data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training
- Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git for version control

## 🗂️ Dataset
Due to GitHub file size limits, the `creditcard.csv` dataset is **not included**.  
You can download it from [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).

Place it in your working directory before running the notebook.

## 🚦 How to Run
1. Clone this repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/VuyyuruSreyan/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
    cd credit-card-fraud-detection
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
    ```
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the model.
